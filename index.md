## Bio

ShortBio 
I am a Project Assistant Professor at Kyoto University, Japan (2025–present), where I work at the intersection of neuroscience, statistical modeling, information theory, machine learning and data-driven brain analysis. Prior to this, I worked as Postdoctoral Researcher at Kyoto University (2023–2025), a University Teaching and Research Assistant at Université Côte d’Azur (formerly Unviversity of Nice), France (2019–2022), and a Researcher at the Institute of Mathematics in Hanoi, Vietnam (2017–2020). I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Université Côte d’Azur (2018–2022), specializing in probability, statistics, and computational neuroscience, following an M.Sc. in Probability and Statistics (2017–2018) and a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Hanoi National University of Education (2012–2016).
